# Number Pattern and Time Calculator

![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400) <!-- Add a banner image here if available -->

*Description:*
This project showcases two interactive tools designed for educational purposes:

1. **Number Pattern Generator:** Create customizable number patterns for learning multiplication tables, addition, and subtraction.
2. **Time Calculator:** Add durations to start times, demonstrating time manipulation and calculation.

These tools are ideal for students, teachers, and anyone interested in improving their math and time management skills.
